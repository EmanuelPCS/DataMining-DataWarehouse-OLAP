# DataMining-DataWarehouse-OLAP
Project developed in SI2 (Sistemas Informação 2) class.

## About the Project
This project aims to analyze and report data from a data warehouse, as well as use classifiers (Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, among others) to create models capable of analyzing data related to residents in the United States.

    - Analysis Services based on the Data Warehouse - SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS);
    - KPI;
    - Excel with pivot tables;
    - PowerBI with pivot tables and a map.
    
  ### Part Two [Data Mining]:
    - Visual Studio:
